# Convolution Operation Implementations in Python

This repository contains implementations of 1D, 2D, and 3D convolution operations from scratch in Python. These implementations serve as a foundational understanding of how convolution operations work, without relying on any deep learning libraries.

## Contents

- `conv1d.py`: Implementation of 1D convolution.
- `conv2d.py`: Implementation of 2D convolution.
- `conv3d.py`: Implementation of 3D convolution.

Each file demonstrates the convolution operation on synthetic data with detailed explanations.

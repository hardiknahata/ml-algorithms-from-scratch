# 🚀 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to my repository where I code **Machine Learning Algorithms** from scratch using only **Python**—no external libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` are used. This project aims to provide a deep understanding of how various ML algorithms work under the hood by breaking them down to their core implementations.

## 🛠️ What's Inside
This repo covers a wide range of **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **K Nearest Neighbours**:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**

## 📚 Learning Goals
This repo is designed to:
- Provide a deeper understanding of the **math** behind machine learning algorithms.
- Reinforce **programming** skills by implementing algorithms without relying on libraries.
- Enable you to customize ML algorithms for specific needs.

## 🧑‍💻 Prerequisites
To follow along, you’ll need:
- **Python 3.7** or higher.
- Basic knowledge of **Linear Algebra**, **Calculus**, and **Probability**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hardiknahata/ml-algorithms-from-scratch.git
   cd ml-algorithms-from-scratch
   ```

2. Run any algorithm:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

## 📝 Documentation
Each folder contains:
- A **Python implementation** of the algorithm.
- A **README** file detailing the theory behind the algorithm.

## 🤝 Contributions
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have improvements or new algorithms to add!

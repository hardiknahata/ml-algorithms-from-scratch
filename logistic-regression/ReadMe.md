# Logistic Regression from Scratch in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using Python. The goal of this project is to help understand the fundamental workings of the logistic regression algorithm without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems. It is used when the target variable is binary (i.e., 0 or 1). This implementation uses gradient descent to optimize the weights and bias and includes the use of the sigmoid activation function to convert linear predictions into probabilities.

## Installation

To use this implementation, clone the repository and install the necessary libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression-scratch.git
cd logistic-regression-scratch
```

The only external library required is `numpy`. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

The logistic regression model is implemented in Python, and you can use it to fit and predict on your own datasets. Below is an example of how to use this implementation.

### Training the Model

```python
import numpy as np
from logistic_regression import LogisticRegression

# Example dataset (X: features, y: labels)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

# Initialize the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(lr=0.01, n_iters=1000)

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, y)

# Print the trained weights and bias
print("Weights:", model.weights)
print("Bias:", model.bias)
```

### Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the class labels for new data.

```python
# Test data
X_test = np.array([[3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Predict class labels (0 or 1)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

## Equations Used

### 1. Linear Prediction

The linear prediction is computed as:

```
z = Xw + b
```

Where:
- `X` is the feature matrix (input data)
- `w` is the weights vector (model parameters)
- `b` is the bias term (a constant added to the result)

### 2. Sigmoid Activation Function

The sigmoid function is used to map the linear prediction to a probability:

```
y_pred = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
```

This converts the value of `z` into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

### 3. Gradient Calculation

To update the weights and bias, we calculate the gradients:

- **Gradient of the weights**:

```
dw = (1 / n) * X^T * (y_pred - y)
```

This is the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weights.

- **Gradient of the bias**:

```
db = (1 / n) * sum(y_pred - y)
```

This is the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the bias.

Where:
- `n` is the number of samples
- `X^T` is the transpose of the input matrix `X`
- `y_pred` is the predicted probability
- `y` is the actual target value

### 4. Weight and Bias Update

Finally, the weights and bias are updated using the calculated gradients and the learning rate:

- **Update the weights**:

```
w = w - lr * dw
```

- **Update the bias**:

```
b = b - lr * db
```

Where `lr` is the learning rate, which controls the step size of the updates.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation in Python

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier from scratch in Python, using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** for optimization. The implementation focuses on a **linear SVM** for binary classification tasks.

## Features

- A simple linear SVM classifier with hinge loss and regularization.
- Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design for modularity and reusability.
- Includes a plotting function to visualize the decision boundary and support vectors.

## Files

- **`svm.py`**: Contains the `SVM` class that implements the SVM algorithm with SGD.
- **`train.py`**: A script to generate a sample dataset, train the SVM model, and plot the decision boundary.

## Code Structure

### `SVM` Class (in `svm.py`)

- **`__init__`**: Initializes the SVM model with hyperparameters `learning_rate`, `lambda_param`, and `n_iters`.
- **`fit`**: Trains the SVM model using SGD to update weights and bias.
- **`predict`**: Predicts the class labels for input data.
- **Gradient Computation**: Applies hinge loss gradient updates based on whether a point is misclassified or correctly classified with margin.

### `train.py`

This script demonstrates how to use the `SVM` class. It generates a linearly separable dataset, initializes an SVM instance, trains the model, and plots the decision boundary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for generating sample data)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svm-implementation.git
cd svm-implementation


2.	Run the train.py script to see SVM classification on a sample dataset:

`python train.py`

This will generate a synthetic dataset, train the SVM model, and plot the decision boundary, showing the separation created by the SVM.

3.	Using the SVM class:
- To use the SVM model on custom data, import the class from svm.py and follow the example in train.py.

## How It Works
- Hinge Loss and Regularization: The SVM aims to maximize the margin by applying a hinge loss and penalizing misclassifications. A regularization term (lambda_param) controls the penalty for misclassification.
- Gradient Descent Optimization: Weights (w) and bias (b) are updated via gradient descent to minimize the hinge loss.
- Decision Boundary: The decision boundary is visualized by classifying points in a grid to illustrate the model’s linear separation.

## Limitations and Extensions
- Linear SVM: This implementation supports only linear SVM. Kernel methods can be added to handle non-linear boundaries.
- Soft Margin SVM: Currently, it assumes linearly separable data. Slack variables can be introduced to support non-separable data.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting learning_rate, lambda_param, and n_iters can improve performance for various datasets.
